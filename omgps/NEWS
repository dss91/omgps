0.1_20090618-2
----------------
1. bugfix: track's src read file fail, http://code.google.com/p/omgps/issues/detail?id=6
           sometime track saves bad records.
           (not sure these issues are fixed, need more tests)
2. bugfix: sound module does not read speed correctly when speed unit is not m/s
3. defect: theme related (on latest SHR): 
           1) UI flush from non-main threads is extreme slow, force gdk_flush().
           2) unable to set "gtk-font-name" by gtk_rc_parse_string() any more, instead 
              use gtk_settings_set_string_property();
              slightly adjust UI layouts by adding scrolled window, etc.
           3) "keep cursor in view" mode, button font color (gray) is not suitable on black bg.
           4) fg/bg of scratch color buttons and center button broken, adjust and rewrite. 
4. defect: don't show gpsfix ctx tab on main view when GPS disconnected. 

known issues:
1. bugfix #1 need more tests
2. occasionally gpsfix tab does not show on main view -- you have to restart
3. "toggled state" of toggle button does not well displayed due to SHR theme.
