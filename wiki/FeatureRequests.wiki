Collected from openmoko mailing list for v0.2 and later.

= Initial mail =

First, I must appreciate all omgps users, for your test and feed back.

Because version 0.1 gets stable for now, and it will be integrated into official openembeded repository, I'm planing start next major developing stage. Here is current plan:

1. better supports for track logging, nuk ask me to add altitude to track log, good point. I can remember complains about the lack of POI, and suggestion of voice recording to help post precess of track logging.

2. support dynamic layers, including POI, openbmap data, etc. my concerns are (1) performance (2) is it possible or necessary to support user defined layers as plugins?

3. and other big things related to routing.

Requirement of version 0.2 will be frozen due 07-07, the core task is to make it track-friendly for OSM map and JOMS application. Please feel free to comment or add new feature requests here.
